# bad_epstein
Given a directory of input frames and a frame pool directory, the program selects the most similar image for each frame and copies it to the output directory with the name of the input frame.

Can probably be used for non-Epstein or Bad Apple related purposes.

Epstein files not included for reasons that should appear obvious.
